# CS50
This is CS50 code files designed to run locally in Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS instead of using https://code.cs50.io site. 

#### Code along the C language in Lectures (L1 - L5)
Follow the instructions on https://github.com/cs50/libcs50 to install the cs50 library for the helper functions. 

Each folder has a makefile to enable the use of the command `$ make <filename>`

## TODO
Make a single make file for use in all the folders instead of creating a mew makefile each time a new folder is made. This is for the C language practise.
